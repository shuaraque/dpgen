Goal: to be able to read in a file of instructions depicting a circuit and run it through a program in C++ using CMake. Our function used 4 different classes. Expression Info for Expressions, Expressions for the vector containing all expressionInfo's.The same logic is done for variables.
Each expression was scaned and parsed for information and then put in an output file that can be used in verilog.
